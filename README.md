## I have solved the bonus question which was to add jest unit test cases
## First we need to install jest.
## Run the command `npm i jest`.
## There are three files 
## 1- Ans.js file which includes only the javascript function. you can run the file by using `node ans.js` command.
## 2- HighlitedContentHtml.test.js which includes the jest unit test cases code. you can run the test cases using `npx jest ` command.
## 3- Index.html file through which we can see the highlited content working.
